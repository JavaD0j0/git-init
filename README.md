## Project Initialization Helper

**Note: These are instructions for Windows OS**

This repo is to help with the start up of creating your project repository with the execution of just one command.
**Instead of ~~6-plus~~ git commands, just run *1* and be done with it!** 

### How to Install:
```
git clone "https://github.com/mronfire/GitInit.git"
cd GitInit
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Set-Up:
- In order to connect to GitHuh and have a determined project folder, we need to make some environment additions...
```
Go to your environments and add the following:
1. project directory = "projectDir"
2. github token = "gittoken"
```

### Hot to Use:
```
create <project_name>
```
